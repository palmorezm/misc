Caveats:
"1. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"3. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"

"4. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"

"5. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
"6. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Not Stated."
"7. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
