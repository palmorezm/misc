Caveats:
"1. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"2. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Racial Differences."
"3. The population figures for years 2021 and 2020 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage"
"2020 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2019 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 25,"
"2020. The population figures for year 2018 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2018"
"postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 20, 2019."
"4. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Age"
"Group."
"5. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"6. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
"7. Deaths related to external causes of injury or sudden death: In the provisional mortality data, causes of death classified as"
"external causes of injury (ICD-10 codes V01-Y89) or sudden deaths (ICD-10 codes R95 and R96) have the cause of death labeled as"
"'Data not shown due to 6 month lag to account for delays in death certificate completion for certain causes of death.' For these"
