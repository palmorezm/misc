## Summary

Some words go here. Copy and Paste from Drive (recently uploaded)

Review for reading in different pages in xlsx. 
https://rpubs.com/tf_peterson/readxl_import

```{r}
xl_data <- "https://github.com/palmorezm/misc/blob/master/Experiments/LEED_Audit.xlsx"
library(readxl)
read_xlsx(xl_data)
read.csv(csv_data) # This method is preferred
# It must be downloaded first or turned into a csv
# Perhaps it can downloaded under R with a specific name and imported into the workspace
# Then its sheets/tabs can be selected and turned into dfs 
```


Look for the filepath again (it has likely changed)

This is an example. A test.
